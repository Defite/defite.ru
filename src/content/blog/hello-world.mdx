Hi and welcome! This is my new blog about web development and, hopefully, not only.

I've started this blog to learn more about Next.js React framework and it's integrations with headless CMS. First attempt was with Storyblok, which is awesome, previous version got all data from my self-hosted Ghost blogging engine and current version relies on mdx files.
