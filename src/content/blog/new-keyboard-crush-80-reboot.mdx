Finally got my new home keyboard for working from home and occasional gaming. My previous keyboard - Keychron K3 - is perfect lowprofile keyboard, but I've always wanted more creamy sound. I had an option with Keychron Q1, but after some researches I've found Wobkey Crush 80 Reboot Pro. It's a perfect match for me!

First of all, I like that it is a heavy keyboard. It has ANSI layout, 75% form-factor with aluminium case and classic (high profile :D) keycaps. 

The second thing I like about it - it has unusual color - red. All my keyboards are black with dark keycaps (but Nuphy has yellow spacebar).

And the last thing - it has magnetic braces in case. This is very helpful, because you can easily disassemble top case of the keyboard and change/add/remove noise canceling layers to your wish.
